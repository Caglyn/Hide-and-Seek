There are 2 versions of the Hide-and-Seek game. 
While one of the games can play the game at the same time, in other game players can move more easily than two-player and includes a race against time in 2 rounds, when the game is over for both players, the winner is printed on the screen according to the scores.

But unfortunately, we have added the video gameplay despite the problem of not opening on every computer.
